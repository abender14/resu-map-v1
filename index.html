        <h3>Hi there! üëã</h3>
        <p>You‚Äôve stumbled upon my resumap ‚Äî welcome!<br/><br/>I created this to further paint a picture of who I am. Without further ado, my name is Alex Bender; I‚Äôm originally from right here in the great state of Colorado.</p>
        <p>In order to understand how I approach professional challenges and before you learn anything else about me, I think you should know that I love climbing mountains... especially Colorado‚Äôs coveted 14ers. I have climbed 45 of them so far!</p>
        <p>Here‚Äôs a picture of me at an elevation of 14,203 feet near the summit of Crestone Needle.
        <br/><br/><img src="images2\crestone.jpg" alt = "Picture of Alex near the top of a mountain"></p>

<p>When found not working or at the top of a mountain, you can find me biking, exploring new cities, and playing disc golf.</p>

        <h3>Grandview High School</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôve lived my whole life before college just outside of Denver in Aurora.
High school overall was a great experience for me. Most of my time was spent on weekend ski trips with friends, playing soccer, and/or studying for AP classes.</p>
<p>I graduated in 2015 as Valedictorian and Student Body President.

        <h3>Northeastern University</h3>
        <img src="images2\nu.png" alt = "Image of Northeastern University logo">
        <p>After leaving high school I was absolutely energized to start my journey at Northeastern University here in Boston. Northeastern has exceeded my expectations.</p>
        <p>When I first started, I was a kid in a candy store. I had no clue what to major in but eventually decided on Industrial Engineering. I admire the field‚Äôs way of thinking and widespread applicability. As a result, I‚Äôve learned to how address complex issues by thinking systemically and systematically.</p>
<p>Involving myself heavily in campus life has given me the wherewithal to be ambitious. Following my first year, I was elected into a year of the Vice President for Student Affairs position within the Student Government Association. The projects my committee and I pushed forward, such as creating the <a href="https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/open/programs-and-services/peer-education/" target="_blank"> first mental health peer education program </a> at Northeastern, have been incredibly impactful for me and my peers. This position was a great opportunity to lead and learn from 30+ committee members while implementing mission-driven projects.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also spent time as one of the only student members on Northeastern‚Äôs <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/crossing/" target="_blank">Community Advisory Board</a>, as an <a href= "https://youtu.be/p1qzQPn40i4?t=109" target="_blank">Orientation Leader</a>, as a Resident Assistant for on-campus residence halls, and as a Husky Ambassador tour guide.</p>

    <section id='lahey'>
        <h3>1st co-op: Lahey Health System</h3>
<p><img src="images2\lahey.png" alt = "Picture of Lahey Health System logo"></p>
        <p>One of Northeastern‚Äôs main draws is its flagship co-op program ‚Äî which enables students to alternate between classes and three 6-month full-time employment opportunities.
This longer term of employment gives students a higher immersion than a typical internship would, plus it gives companies a robust talent pipeline and skilled student employees (especially with subsequent co-ops). What a win-win! üèÜ
</p>
<p>My first 6-month co-op was as an Associate Performance Improvement Project Manager at Lahey Health System. My main role was to use the process improvement toolbox (such as Lean six sigma, systems thinking, value stream mapping, and statistical analysis) to improve clinical and administrative experiences at the subsidiary hospitals. I was also involved in presenting recommendations to executive leadership regarding which clinics to invest in based on collected and analyzed data.</p>
<p>AND! Having the opportunity to shadow an open heart surgery during co-op was pretty cool too ‚ù§Ô∏è. </p>

    <section id='marathon'>
        <h3>Boston Marathon</h3>
        <p>Since high school, I‚Äôve always enjoyed and made time for volunteering. One of my favorite experiences has been volunteering at the finish line of the Boston Marathon as part of the Green Team sustainability composting and recycling effort. You know all those bananas, CLIF Bars, and water bottles that the runners scarf down upon completing the race? Yeah, we‚Äôre in charge of making sure those are disposed of <b>sustainably</b>. </p>
        <p>I‚Äôm approaching my 6th year as a volunteer now! One day I hope to run this race.</p>

        <h3>Delft, Netherlands üá≥üá±</h3>
        <p>During the summer of 2017, I was lucky enough to study abroad in the Netherlands at TU Delft with a group of other Northeastern students. Our classes were focused on sustainable urban transportation; this program inoculated me with the ideals of a future with human-centered cities.</p>
        <p><img src="images2\nl.jpg" alt = "Picture of Alex riding a bicycle with friends in the Netherlands."></p>
        <p>My team and I proposed redesigns to Boston roads guided by Dutch principles in bicycle infrastructure, pedestrian friendliness, traffic stress, roadway treatments, and multi-modal mobility (<a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/holland2017sustrans/?page_id=483" target="_blank">Centre St.</a>, <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/holland2017sustrans/?page_id=1142" target="_blank">Charles St., Columbus Ave.</a>).
I also authored an <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/holland2017sustrans/?page_id=531" target="_blank">interactive report</a> on how United States neighborhoods can learn from Dutch 30 kmh zone safety precautions. Check it out!
</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a video I made capturing my trip to the Netherlands.

        <h3>2nd co-op: PricewaterhouseCoopers</h3>
        <p>Upon returning to the US, and after another semester in Boston, I soared on down to New York City to begin my second 6-month co-op at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in their mergers & acquisitions (M&A) management consulting team. </p>
        <p><img src="images2\pwc.jpg" alt = "Picture of Alex next to the PwC logo."></p>
        <p>I‚Äôve realized that learning is much ‚Äústickier‚Äù on a co-op; it stays with you more effortlessly. In this co-op, I furthered my depth of knowledge in data analysis, data visualization, project management, client-facing work, and corporate/business development.</p>
        <p>Real conversation from my first day of co-op: <br/>
        My coach - ‚ÄúHey Alex, you‚Äôre on a project in Chicago. Your team is expecting you to be there tomorrow at 8:00am.‚Äù<br/>
Me- ‚Äúüò≤Wow that was quick!‚Äù</p>

        <p>So after my Flight to Chicago on my second day of work, üõ´ I began my first day on this 3 month M&A project!</p>
        <p><img src="images2\chicago.jpg" alt = "Picture of the chicago skyline"></p>
        <p>At this client, I learned an immense amount about the inner workings of companies, motivations behind M&A activity, and how to create and present dynamic data visualizations to executive leadership.</p>

        <h3>Bay Area Client</h3>
        <p>My next client was in the San Francisco Bay Area. I was here for the remaining time of my co-op. The main takeaways from my time here were how to scramble to put together a competition-crushing RFP proposal and how to do sentiment analysis to drive decision making using tools such as <a href="https://quid.com/" target="_blank">Quid</a>.</p>
        <p>Having the opportunity to travel around and work with very little distinction between myself and the full-time staff was maturing and empowering.</p>

        <p>Immediately following my co-op at PwC, I traveled to Seoul, South Korea to do another summer study abroad program ‚Äî this time at Yonsei University. The focus of this program was Korean film and culture. <br/>
        ‚ÄúBut Alex, that‚Äôs not at all related to your major!‚Äù I know, and that‚Äôs the beauty of it.</p>
        <p>Taking courses outside my direct degree plan has been enriching. I am a believer that this has empowered me to be more globally-minded, culturally agile, and resourceful. </p>
		<p>Seoul was astonishing. <br/>

        <p>The Fall 2018 semester was when I started my Masters of Science in Engineering Management. I have taken courses in Data Visualization, Machine Learning/Data Mining, Data Science, and Financial Management.</p>
        <p>This semester further galvanized my drive to use data to solve important problems.
One of my favorite projects has been using several data mining/machine learning techniques such as k-nearest-neighbors, decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble learning to predict the happiness score of nations of the world based on country characteristics and UN human development data. </p>

        <h3>Final Semester at NU</h3>
        <p> After completing my 3rd and final co-op in Colorado, I shipped back to Boston to take my final semester head on. Boy if only I would have known how the Spring 2020 semester would pan out! </p>
  <p> When found not trying to experience college bucket list items with my friends (such as creating a definitive list of the <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/oSewfZvLJ3kPzFGW7" target="_blank"> 10 best Hidden Gem views in Boston</a>), I jumped right into tackling my Senior Capstone Project. My team and I created a functional prototype and conceptual proof-of-concept for a Blockchain based peer-to-peer lending platform, Appearo. </p>
  <p> I served as the chief software engineer for the project and <b>was responsible for </b> creating and delivering an accurate ensemble machine learning model, project website, and functional Blockchain lending prototype built with AWS. </p>
  <p>The driving force behind the whole year long project was to propose a technical and human-centered solution that, if commercialized, has the potential to positively impact security, equity, and transparency in credit lending. Our solution included a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of defaulting on a loan with over 90% accuracy across 9 algorithms, a methodology for quantifying five non-financial factors related to creditworthiness, and the intended evaluation, deployment, and impact of peer-to-peer lending on a blockchain platform. </p>

<p>Take a look! I‚Äôm super proud of the hard work that went into this Capstone. It yielded our team the <b>Impact Award</b>, the highest honor among the Mechanical and Industrial Engineering Department‚Äôs 2020 Capstone groups. </p>

        <h3>Graduation Awards and Honors</h3>
        <p>Though the onset of COVID forced my final 2 months of college to be virtual and caused my graduation ceremony to be cancelled, I still found this semester to be incredibly gratifying. I graduated Summa Cum Laude in May 2020 with my BS in Industrial Engineering and MS in Engineering Management.</p>
        <p>Upon graduating I was recognized with a few honors/awards for which I am incredibly grateful.</p>

        <h3>Full-time at Boom Supersonic</h3>
        <p>Immediately after graduating in May 2020, I started full-time work at Boom Supersonic ‚Äì the same company I did my 3rd co-op for hired me! The co-op program really works!</p>
        <p>I started as a FP&A Manager. For nearly 10 months I was the only member of the Finance team other than our VP of Finance/CFO. This position enabled me to deeply learn about and contribute to operational budgets, financial modelling, scenario planning, private fundraising, SPAC sponsorship, <a href="https://boomsupersonic.com/united" target="_blank">business development</a>, board meetings, and much more. The small nature of our team led to a very high-pace work environment, but I know it paid immense dividends from all the knowledge and experience I gained.</p>
        <p>About 10 months in, I was the hiring manager for a Financial Analyst as well as a key decision maker for a new Director of Finance. Once they were hired and transitioned, it became clear that we needed to upgrade the tools we used for financial modeling, budgeting, and forecasting. I transitioned into being the company‚Äôs Business Intelligence Engineer due to my technical background and mixture of engineering and business experience.</p>
        <p>I spearheaded a project to choose and implement a new Business Intelligence tool companywide, which vastly upgraded Senior Leadership‚Äôs ability to make decisions and trust a single source of truth. I was responsible for creating the backend data pipelines (connecting to several sources of real-time data through APIs) as well as the frontend data visualizations that fueled the dashboards that various stakeholders needed.</p>
        <p>Once I delivered and sustainably transitioned this multi-month project, I decided to leave Boom Supersonic and tackle my next adventure!</p>

        <h3>8-month road trip</h3>
        <p>After graduation, as a personal celebration for finishing college, I was supposed to do a 6-month international backpacking trip before starting my first job. As I‚Äôm sure you can guess, the COVID-19 pandemic had different plans. I was really enjoying my career, but I still had this strong urge to do a post-graduation trip while I‚Äôm still within earshot of college. I finally decided to commit to this life experience and make the most of it!</p>
        <p>After leaving Boom Supersonic, I embarked on an 8-month continuous US road trip.</p>
        <p> I purchased a Nissan Frontier, put a topper on the back of it, and built a camper in the back that enabled me to sleep, camp, cook, and store all of my things for the road trip. This ended up being an incredibly fun engineering project; it also yielded a perfect road tripping vehicle! I call it ‚Äúvan-life lite‚Äù.</p>
        <p><img src="images2\frontier.JPG" width="85%" height="85%" alt = "Picture of Nissan Frontier"></p>
        <p>Over the course of the road trip, I:</p>
      <p>  <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
  <li>Visited 54 of the 100 largest US metropolitan areas (and biked in many of them)</li>
  <li>Drove almost 30,000 miles</li>
  <li>Experienced 10 states I hadn‚Äôt yet been to</li>
  <li>Enjoyed 20+ National Parks, Historic Sites, and Monuments</li>
  <li>Summited 5+ mountains</li>
  <li>Played 40 disc golf courses</li>
  <li>Saw countless wildlife species</li>
  <li>Was asked once by police to relocate my van at 4:00am</li>
  <li>Fixed 1 flat tire</li>
  <li>Got 6 oil changes</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>I spent time with friends, family, new friends, and solo. Overall, this experience has been incredibly energizing and has made me extremely excited to continue experiencing life head on. </p>

        <h3>Now what‚Äôs next?</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôm not sure. But one thing is for certain... I can‚Äôt wait to continue this journeyüó∫Ô∏è. My immediate next step is to find an awesome full-time career opportunity now that I am done with my road-trip üìÖ.</p>
        <p>Thank you for stopping by! I hope you enjoyed flying through some chapters of my life. Please contact me with any questions or comments you may have!</p>
