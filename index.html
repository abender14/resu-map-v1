        <h3>Hi there! üëã</h3>
        <p>You‚Äôve stumbled upon my resumap ‚Äî welcome!<br/><br/>I created this to further paint the picture of who I am. Without further ado, my name is Alex Bender; I‚Äôm originally from right here in the great state of Colorado.</p>
        <p>In order to understand how I approach professional challenges and before you learn anything else about me, I think you should know that I love climbing mountains... especially Colorado‚Äôs coveted 14ers. I have climbed 25 of them so far!</p>
        <p>Here‚Äôs a picture of me at an elevation of 14,203 feet near the summit of Crestone Needle.
        <br/><br/><img src="images2\crestone.jpg" alt = "Picture of Alex near the top of a mountain"></p>

<p>When found not contributing to mission-driven projects, you can find me biking, exploring new cities, and playing the mandolin.</p>

    <section id='ghs' class='active'>
        <h3>Grandview High School</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôve lived my whole life before college just outside of Denver in Aurora.
High school overall was a great experience for me. Most of my time was spent on weekend ski trips with friends, playing soccer, and/or studying for AP classes.</p>
<p>I graduated in 2015 as Valedictorian and Student Body President.
<br/><br/><img src="images2\graduation.jpg" alt = "Picture of Alex with 2 friends after high school graduation."></p>

    <section id='nu'>
        <h3>Northeastern University</h3>
        <img src="images2\nu.png" alt = "Image of Northeastern University logo">
        <p>After leaving high school I was absolutely energized to start my journey at Northeastern University here in Boston. Northeastern has exceeded my expectations.</p>
        <p>When I first started, I was a kid in a candy store. I had no clue what to major in but eventually decided on Industrial Engineering. I admire the field‚Äôs way of thinking and widespread applicability. I‚Äôve learned to think of things as a system, a very useful notion when tackling complex issues.</p>
<p>Involving myself heavily in campus life has given me the wherewithal to be ambitious. Following my first year, I was elected into a year of the Vice President for Student Affairs position within the Student Government Association. The projects my committee and I pushed forward, such as creating the <a href="https://studentlife.northeastern.edu/open/programs-and-services/peer-education/" target="_blank"> first mental health peer education program </a> at Northeastern, have been incredibly impactful for me and my peers. This position was a great opportunity to lead and learn from 30+ committee members while implementing mission-driven projects.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve also spent time as one of the only student members on Northeastern‚Äôs <a href="https://www.northeastern.edu/crossing/" target="_blank">Community Advisory Board</a>, as an <a href= "https://youtu.be/p1qzQPn40i4?t=109" target="_blank">Orientation Leader</a>, as a Resident Assistant for on-campus residence halls, and as a Husky Ambassador tour guide.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='lahey'>
        <h3>1st co-op: Lahey Health System</h3>
<p><img src="images2\lahey.png" alt = "Picture of Lahey Health System logo"></p>
        <p>One of Northeastern‚Äôs main draws is its flagship co-op program ‚Äî which enables students to alternate between classes and three 6-month full-time employment opportunities.
This longer term of employment gives students a higher immersion than a typical internship would, plus it gives companies a robust talent pipeline and skilled student employees (especially with subsequent co-ops). What a win-win! üèÜ
</p>
<p>My first 6-month co-op was as an Associate Performance Improvement Project Manager at Lahey Health System. My main role was to use the process improvement toolbox (such as Lean six sigma, systems thinking, value stream mapping, and statistical analysis) to improve clinical and administrative experiences at the subsidiary hospitals. I was also involved in presenting recommendations to executive leadership regarding which clinics to invest in based on collected and analyzed data.</p>
<p>AND! Having the opportunity to shadow an open heart surgery during co-op was pretty cool too ‚ù§Ô∏è. </p>
    </section>
    <section id='marathon'>
        <h3>Boston Marathon</h3>
        <p>Since high school, I‚Äôve always enjoyed and made time for volunteering. One of my favorite experiences has been volunteering at the finish line of the Boston Marathon as part of a composting and recycling effort. You know all those bananas, CLIF Bars, and water bottles that the runners scarf down upon completing the race? Yeah, we‚Äôre in charge of making sure those are disposed of <b>sustainably</b>. </p>
        <p>I‚Äôm approaching my 4th year as a volunteer now! One day I hope to run this race.</p>

    <section id='nl'>
        <h3>Delft, Netherlands üá≥üá±</h3>
        <p>During the summer of 2017, I was lucky enough to study abroad in the Netherlands at TU Delft with a group of other Northeastern students. Our classes were focused on sustainable urban transportation; this program inoculated me with the ideals of a future with human-centered cities.</p>
        <p><img src="images2\nl.jpg" alt = "Picture of Alex riding a bicycle with friends in the Netherlands."></p>
        <p>My team and I proposed redesigns to Boston roads guided by Dutch principles in bicycle infrastructure, pedestrian friendliness, traffic stress, roadway treatments, and multi-modal mobility (<a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/holland2017sustrans/?page_id=483" target="_blank">Centre St.</a>, <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/holland2017sustrans/?page_id=1142" target="_blank">Charles St., Columbus Ave.</a>).
I also authored an <a href="https://web.northeastern.edu/holland2017sustrans/?page_id=531" target="_blank">interactive report</a> on how United States neighborhoods can learn from Dutch 30 kmh zone safety precautions. Check it out!
</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a video I made capturing my trip to the Netherlands.

    <section id='europe'>
        <h3>Europe Travel</h3>
        <p>After this study abroad opportunity, I was fortunate enough to have had the time to backpack around 5 other European nations (Germany, Czech Republic, Italy, France, Belgium) ‚Äî This gem was taken in Chamonix-Mont-Blanc!</p>
        <p><img src="images2\montblanc.jpg" alt = "Picture of Mont Blanc take from Le Brevent during Alex's backpacking trip."></p>

<section id='pwc1'>
        <h3>2nd co-op: PricewaterhouseCoopers</h3>
        <p>Upon returning to the US, and after another semester in Boston, I soared on down to New York City to begin my second 6-month co-op at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in their mergers & acquisitions (M&A) management consulting team. </p>
        <p><img src="images2\pwc.jpg" alt = "Picture of Alex next to the PwC logo."></p>
        <p>I‚Äôve realized that learning is much ‚Äústickier‚Äù on a co-op; it stays with you more effortlessly. In this co-op, I furthered my depth of knowledge in data analysis, data visualization, project management, client-facing work, and corporate/business development.</p>
        <p>Real conversation from my first day of co-op: <br/>
        My coach - ‚ÄúHey Alex, you‚Äôre on a project in Chicago. Your team is expecting you to be there tomorrow at 8:00am.‚Äù<br/>
Me- ‚Äúüò≤Wow that was quick!‚Äù</p>
    </section>
    <section id='pwc2'>
        <h3>Chicago Client</h3>
        <p>So after my Flight to Chicago on my second day of work, üõ´ I began my first day on this 3 month M&A project!</p>
        <p><img src="images2\chicago.jpg" alt = "Picture of the chicago skyline"></p>
        <p>At this client, I learned an immense amount about the inner workings of companies, motivations behind M&A activity, and how to create and present dynamic data visualizations to executive leadership.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='pwc3'>
        <h3>Bay Area Client</h3>
        <p>My next client was in the San Francisco Bay Area. I was here for the remaining time of my co-op. The main takeaways from my time here were how to scramble to put together a competition-crushing RFP proposal and how to do sentiment analysis to drive decision making using tools such as <a href="https://quid.com/" target="_blank">Quid</a>.</p>
        <p>Having the opportunity to travel around and work with very little distinction between myself and the full-time staff was maturing and empowering.</p>
    </section>
    <section id='korea'>
        <h3>Seoul, South Korea üá∞üá∑</h3>
        <p>Immediately following my co-op at PwC, I traveled to Seoul, South Korea to do another summer study abroad program ‚Äî this time at Yonsei University. The focus of this program was Korean film and culture. <br/>
        ‚ÄúBut Alex, that‚Äôs not at all related to your major!‚Äù I know, and that‚Äôs the beauty of it.</p>
        <p>Taking courses outside my direct degree plan has been enriching. I am a believer that this has empowered me to be more globally-minded, culturally agile, and resourceful. </p>
		<p>Seoul was astonishing. <br/>
      <img src="images2\seoul.JPG" width="90%" height="90%" alt = "Picture of Seoul city streets"></p>
    <p>I also had the unique opportunity to step into North Korea (technically) at the DMZ.<br/><br/>

        <h3>Busan, South Korea üá∞üá∑</h3>
        <p>We also spent some time in Busan ‚Äî one of my favorite cities.</p>
        <p>Check out this short film I made during my program.<br/><br/><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9u6hEsV6jQg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

        <h3>Asia Travel</h3>
        <p>After the conclusion of my time in South Korea, I backpacked around Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, and Japan. It was the time of my life!</p>

    <section id='grad'>
        <h3>Graduate courses at Northeastern</h3>
        <p>The Fall 2018 semester was when I started my Masters of Science in Engineering Management. I have taken courses in Data Visualization, Machine Learning/Data Mining, Data Science, and Financial Management.</p>
        <p>This semester further galvanized my drive to use data to solve important problems.
One of my favorite projects has been using several data mining/machine learning techniques such as k-nearest-neighbors, decision trees, neural networks, and ensemble learning to predict the happiness score of nations of the world based on country characteristics and UN human development data. </p>
<p>Here is my project presentation:<br/><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iE8LTrmSqps" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

        <h3>3rd co-op: Boom Supersonic</h3>
        <p> After some time in Boston, I accepted a co-op at <a href="https://news.northeastern.edu/2019/10/15/on-the-verge-of-supersonic-air-travels-comeback-alex-bender-is-working-at-boom-supersonic-to-help-develop-a-commercial-supersonic-aircraft/" target="_blank">Boom Supersonic</a>, a company solving an incredibly exhilarating problem ‚Äì creating history‚Äôs first privately developed supersonic aircraft. At Boom, I contributed to both engineering and finance, which gave me exposure to the two main drivers behind the success of our business. </p>
  <p> I worked on financial models for investment rounds, aircraft structures analyses, building automated data pipelines, and more. This experience energized my passion for the aerospace/aviation industry, as well as for start-ups!</p>

        <h3>Now what‚Äôs next?</h3>
        <p>I‚Äôm not sure. But one thing is for certain... I can‚Äôt wait to continue this journeyüó∫Ô∏è. My immediate next step is to find an awesome full-time career opportunity for post-graduation üìÖ.</p>
